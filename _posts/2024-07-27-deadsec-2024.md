We can see this image shows a login screen for **Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise**. It has 3 users: admin, *Leanrdo*, and guest. I focused on user `Leandro Couto Nunes` and looked at him on various popular social media sites, but there was no result. I remembered a website called [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) that can help me find everything related to Internet-connected devices. Finally, I found his computer's IP.
