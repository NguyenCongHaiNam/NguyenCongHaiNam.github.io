We can see this image shows a login screen for **Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise**. It has 3 users: admin, *Leanrdo*, and guest. I focused on user `Leandro Couto Nunes` and looked at him on various popular social media sites, but there was no result. I remembered a website called [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) that can help me find everything related to Internet-connected devices. Finally, I found his computer's IP.

    The second challenge provides an image

<br>
We can see that this image shows a place. When I search on Google, I can't find anything related to this place, so I use [Yandex](https://yandex.com/), the best search engine in Russia, to find the most characteristic building.
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/colorbuilding-ds.png" alt="Challenge" />
</div>
<br>
But I can't find it because this area has many of the same buildings. I changed the target of the building to have a signboard, and here is the result:
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/yandex-ds.png" alt="Challenge" />
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/yandexmap-ds.png" alt="Challenge" />
</div>
<br>
After that, I used a Yandex map to find exactly where this picture was taken.
